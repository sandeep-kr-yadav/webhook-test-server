## Option 4: Heroku

   ```

3. **Deploy**
   ```bash
   git push heroku main
   ```

## Testing Your Deployed Application

Once deployed, test your webhook server:

### 1. Health Check
```bash
curl https://your-app-url/health
```

### 2. Web UI
Visit `https://your-app-url` in your browser

### 3. Webhook Test
```bash
curl -X POST https://your-app-url/webhook \
  -F "json_data={\"event\":\"test\",\"data\":{\"message\":\"Hello from deployed server!\"}}" \
  -F "description=Deployment test"
```

### 4. File Upload Test
```bash
curl -X POST https://your-app-url/webhook \
  -F "file_pdf=@test-files/sample.pdf" \
  -F "description=File upload test"
```

## Environment Variables

The application supports these environment variables:

- `PORT`: Server port (default: 8080)
- Railway/Render/Fly.io will automatically set this

## Monitoring

- **Health Check**: `https://your-app-url/health`
- **Web UI**: `https://your-app-url`
- **API**: `https://your-app-url/api/requests`

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **Build fails**: Check that all files are committed to GitHub
2. **Port issues**: The app automatically uses the `PORT` environment variable
3. **File uploads**: Ensure your hosting platform supports file uploads
4. **WebSocket**: Some platforms may require additional configuration for WebSocket support

### Logs:
- Railway: View logs in the Railway dashboard
- Render: View logs in the Render dashboard
- Fly.io: `fly logs`
- Heroku: `heroku logs --tail`

## Cost Considerations

All platforms mentioned offer free tiers:
- **Railway**: $5/month after free tier (very generous)
- **Render**: $7/month after free tier
- **Fly.io**: $1.94/month after free tier
- **Heroku**: $7/month after free tier

The free tiers should be sufficient for testing and development purposes.
